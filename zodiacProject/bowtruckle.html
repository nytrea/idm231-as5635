            Bowtruckles may keep to themselves, but they are very thoughtful and considerate. Their priority 
            lies in protecting oneself first and prefers alone time. Self care is quite valuable to them. Bowtruckles 
            are also intuitive and in tune with their emotions, and are wonderful friends to those they love.
