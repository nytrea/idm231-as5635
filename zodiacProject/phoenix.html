            The Phoenix is a greatly revered creature who is extremely loyal, intelligent, and helpful. They are emotionally intelligent 
            and can help heal those around them. With the ability to be reborn from flames, Phoenixes can overcome difficult 
            situations and come back as a stronger being.
